            <h1>Manga</h1>
            <p>I enjoy reading manga, especially stories like Blame!, Ascension, Made in Abyss and more recently graphic novels such as Shangri-La. These works captivate me with their rich worlds, compelling characters, and unique art styles. However, I find myself reading less lately as I dedicate more time to sports, which is a significant part of my routine.</p>
